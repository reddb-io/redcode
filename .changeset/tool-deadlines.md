Stop a tool that never returns instead of letting it hold the turn open

Most tools carry no bound of their own, so a read on a dead mount or an MCP call to a process that went away kept a turn running with no output and no error — and the turn's inactivity watchdog could not help, because a tool in flight is deliberately counted as work. Tool calls now have a ten minute backstop, reported to the model as an ordinary tool failure it can react to. Tools that legitimately take as long as they take are exempt (`shell`, `bash`, `question`, `task`), and time spent waiting on a permission prompt is not charged against the tool. Configurable via `experimental.tool_timeout`, `false` to disable.
