Bound the model calls a turn makes that are not the turn itself

Naming a session and compacting the conversation both call a provider outside the step loop, where the turn's inactivity watchdog cannot see them: one runs before any step handle exists, the other creates a processor of its own. A provider that stopped answering during either held the turn open with nothing on screen and no error. Both now give up — naming after two minutes, compacting after ten — and say so. A session keeping its default name is a far smaller loss than a turn that never starts. Configurable via `experimental.aux_timeout`.
