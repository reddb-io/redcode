Notice when the model is repeating itself, and say so instead of asking the user

The old detector compared the last three parts of a single assistant message and required byte-identical serialized input, so one interleaved reasoning part — which reasoning models emit constantly — reset it permanently, a loop spanning steps was invisible, and when it did fire it asked a question whose wait had no bound: the only defence against a loop was itself a way to hang. It now looks across the whole turn, counts only calls that returned the same result (identical calls with different results are polling, and are left alone), and answers the repeated call itself with a correction quoting the model's own arguments and the answer it keeps ignoring. If the correction changes nothing, the turn ends. Nobody is asked anything. Configurable via `experimental.loop_guard`; a `doom_loop: "allow"` permission rule still turns it off.
