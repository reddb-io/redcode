Ask for a report before the step ceiling instead of cutting the turn off at it

The turn ceiling was a cliff: at step 200 the turn stopped and everything the model had worked out but not yet written down went with it, leaving the user told to "send another message to continue" with nothing to base it on. The last steps before the wall are now spent the way `agent.steps` already spends its own: tools off, a summary of what was done, what is left, and what to do next. The wall itself is unchanged, for a model that will not yield. Configurable via `experimental.turn_steps`.
