## 1.20.1

### Patch Changes

- be2fcd5: Build is red, plan is gold, design is cyan — everywhere, including the loading bar

  The brand theme had set primary, secondary and accent all to RedDB reds, and agents took their colour from that palette by position, so every mode looked the same. Each built-in agent now names its colour: build red, plan gold, design a cyan a shade under bright. The TUI's loading scanner takes its head from the agent's own colour instead of the theme accent, so it changes with the mode again. The app gets a design token to match.

- b331e2e: Ported from upstream: tolerate Anthropic's thinking block binding on Claude 5.1+

  Fable 5.1 binds each thinking signature to the system prompt, tool list and messages above it, and rejects the request when any of that changes between turns. Requests to Claude 5.1+ (direct, Vertex, Bedrock) now ask the API to drop the affected blocks instead of failing, via patched `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 3.0.111 and `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock` 4.0.166; the blocks Anthropic reports dropping are logged. Set `thinking.blockBinding: false` (or `reasoningConfig.blockBinding: false` on Bedrock) in the model's provider options to opt out.

- 4ad8dc9: Ported from upstream: Azure CLI authentication, Codex model filtering, Copilot session header, GitLab provider bump

  Azure can authenticate through the Azure CLI, without a Bun dependency, and its model discovery is gone (it logged to stdout and added nothing); Codex accepts integer GPT versions and compares them by major and minor; GitHub Copilot sends the interaction id with the session; `gitlab-ai-provider` 6.13.0.

- f9100dc: Ported from upstream: session, provider list, database and apply-patch fixes

  `/connect` shows the providers that are actually authenticated; session request headers are restored after compaction and the parent session header is sent; a database whose legacy migration history is missing is recovered instead of refusing to start; `apply_patch` no longer emits an empty move path.

- 150c010: Ported from upstream: seven provider and stream fixes

  Cerebras keeps its completion limit; Vertex multi-region models route through the regional endpoint; non-native providers behind Cloudflare AI Gateway go through its REST API, and Anthropic's dashed slug is sent correctly through it; Bedrock reasoning that cannot be replayed is filtered before caching, and a `none` reasoning effort is accepted; a cancelled SSE reader no longer surfaces an unhandled rejection.

- 9c22b55: Ported from upstream: console device URLs, GitHub OIDC subjects, and test hygiene

  Console device-auth URLs resolve correctly; the GitHub app accepts immutable OIDC subjects; development runs on native runtime conditions instead of `--conditions=browser`; a test guards that every patched dependency is at the version its patch targets (and drops a patch for a version nothing uses); the core test preload disables npm audits.

## 1.20.0

### Minor Changes

- c5cf65a: Design mode: work out what something should be by building it, then turn that into a plan

  A third mode beside build and plan. The `design` agent writes a prototype into `.redcode/designs/`, opens it with `design_preview`, and the user talks back from either side: alt-click an element in the browser (or the app's new Design tab) and say what should change, or just say it in the chat. Each preview carries craft notes when the prototype reaches for the patterns reviewers recognise as generated. `design.json` beside the prototype keeps the decisions settled and the questions open, and `design_exit` writes the plan from it. Behind `REDCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_MODE`.

## 1.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 68c96b4: Write down every time a guard intervenes, so the thresholds can be argued from evidence

  Five guards ship in 0.14.0 — the inactivity watchdog, tool deadlines, the loop guard, the step budget, the bounds on naming and compacting — and every threshold in them was chosen by argument, because there was nothing to measure. Each intervention is now recorded with which guard fired, what it acted on, and what it did, and published as a live `session.next.guard.tripped` event. `redcode debug guards` reads it back: counts per guard and action over the last week, loudest first, plus the most recent trips. An empty report says so in words, because "nothing fired" and "nothing was collected" are different answers.

- 7246ae1: Notice a call that never stops being made, even when the answer keeps changing

  Comparing results is what keeps the loop guard off polling's back, and it was also the way through it: an answer carrying a timestamp, a pid or a temporary path never repeats byte for byte, so the same call could run all turn without ever counting as repetition. At twelve identical calls in a row the repetition is mentioned once — the call still runs, because polling looks exactly like this and is sometimes right. Configurable as `experimental.loop_guard.nudge_at`.

## 1.18.19

### Patch Changes

- 78d1b03: Bound the model calls a turn makes that are not the turn itself

  Naming a session and compacting the conversation both call a provider outside the step loop, where the turn's inactivity watchdog cannot see them: one runs before any step handle exists, the other creates a processor of its own. A provider that stopped answering during either held the turn open with nothing on screen and no error. Both now give up — naming after two minutes, compacting after ten — and say so. A session keeping its default name is a far smaller loss than a turn that never starts. Configurable via `experimental.aux_timeout`.

- 8c43207: Notice when the model is repeating itself, and say so instead of asking the user

  The old detector compared the last three parts of a single assistant message and required byte-identical serialized input, so one interleaved reasoning part — which reasoning models emit constantly — reset it permanently, a loop spanning steps was invisible, and when it did fire it asked a question whose wait had no bound: the only defence against a loop was itself a way to hang. It now looks across the whole turn, counts only calls that returned the same result (identical calls with different results are polling, and are left alone), and answers the repeated call itself with a correction quoting the model's own arguments and the answer it keeps ignoring. If the correction changes nothing, the turn ends. Nobody is asked anything. Configurable via `experimental.loop_guard`; a `doom_loop: "allow"` permission rule still turns it off.

- 603d8c7: Ask for a report before the step ceiling instead of cutting the turn off at it

  The turn ceiling was a cliff: at step 200 the turn stopped and everything the model had worked out but not yet written down went with it, leaving the user told to "send another message to continue" with nothing to base it on. The last steps before the wall are now spent the way `agent.steps` already spends its own: tools off, a summary of what was done, what is left, and what to do next. The wall itself is unchanged, for a model that will not yield. Configurable via `experimental.turn_steps`.

- 86b2250: Stop a tool that never returns instead of letting it hold the turn open

  Most tools carry no bound of their own, so a read on a dead mount or an MCP call to a process that went away kept a turn running with no output and no error — and the turn's inactivity watchdog could not help, because a tool in flight is deliberately counted as work. Tool calls now have a ten minute backstop, reported to the model as an ordinary tool failure it can react to. Tools that legitimately take as long as they take are exempt (`shell`, `bash`, `question`, `task`), and time spent waiting on a permission prompt is not charged against the tool. Configurable via `experimental.tool_timeout`, `false` to disable.
