// Container-first (ADR 0021): the feature is a named size container, and its
// media and content share one line from the DS's `3xl` container step (48rem)
// and stack below it — measured against the feature's own width, never the
// window's. The root cannot query its own width, so the steps are on the two
// regions (a flex-wrap row whose regions are a full line each until they fit
// side by side). `mediaSide="end"` moves the media after the content with
// `order`, so it trails both side by side and stacked. The gap between the
// two is the Density layout tier (ADR 0024).
