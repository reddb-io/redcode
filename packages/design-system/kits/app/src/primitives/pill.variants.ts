// Pill's styling. See button.variants.ts for the split, the colour rule and the
// spatial rule — under which only the medium size's inset lands on a role the
// axis ships. The small size is a notch below the narrowest one, and a value
// the axis has no role for stays a step rather than being pushed onto the
// nearest, which would move what the neutral stop renders.
//
// A Pill is round-ended (`rounded-full`) and stands on its own: a filter that
// is on, a tag, a selected facet. That is why it — unlike Badge — has a size
// axis and a dismissible affordance.
//
// What a Pill means is `tone`, the one semantic vocabulary (ADR 0026), and how
// strongly it is drawn is `variant`, its emphasis axis — the same two axes, and
// the same pairs, as the Base Badge, so a `tone="warning"` Pill and a
// `tone="warning"` Badge are one Feedback Role. No tone fills with the Brand
// red: red on a status is danger (ADR 0023).
