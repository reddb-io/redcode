// The interaction-state contract every quiet control draws (wave 6A).
//
// A quiet control is anything a person can press that carries no fill and no
// boundary of its own at rest: a ghost Button, an icon-only button, a close or
// dismiss "×", a tab, an accordion trigger, a navigation item, a pager, a
// carousel or deck dot, a sort header, a tree toggle. Before this recipe each
// drew its own states, and about half of them changed nothing but the text
// colour on hover. Now every one of them answers the pointer the same way:
//
// - rest: transparent, so it sits on whatever ground it lands on;
// - hover: the quiet fill, `bg-foreground/8`. Tailwind 4 compiles `hover:`
//   inside `@media (hover: hover)`, so a touch screen never keeps a sticky
//   fill after a tap;
// - pressed: the stronger quiet fill, `bg-foreground/12` — the touch screen's
//   only feedback, so it must be stronger than hover, not equal to it. A
//   trigger holding its popup open (`aria-haspopup` + `aria-expanded`) wears
//   the open fill, `bg-foreground/10`;
// - focus: the ink outline every control draws (ADR 0023), outside the control
//   by default and inside it (`focus: "inset"`) where a scroll region would
//   clip one drawn outside;
// - disabled: half opacity and no pointer, Button's treatment;
// - selected: the selection language (DESIGN.md, "Interactive states"): the
//   selected surface `bg-foreground/10`, full-weight ink, and — where the
//   component draws one — the 2px ink edge. A selected item does not lighten
//   under the pointer.
//
// Button's ghost variant is this recipe. A component whose element is not a
// Button wraps its own slot classes in it, `quietControl({ class: … })`, so the
// slot only adds geometry and the states stay here. kit-lint's rule 8 checks
// that every raw interactive element in a Kit does one or the other.
