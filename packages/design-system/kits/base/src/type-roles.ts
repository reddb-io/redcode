// tailwind-variants resolves conflicting classes with tailwind-merge, which
// only knows Tailwind's default type scale. To it, `text-display` is an
// unknown text utility and so a colour — it would silently drop either the role or
// `text-foreground` from the same element. Declaring the roles as font sizes
// keeps both, and lets a caller's `class="text-caption"` replace a role
// rather than stack on it.
