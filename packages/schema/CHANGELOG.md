- 82bb18a: Say what a busy session is actually doing

  `session.status` reported `busy` as a bare tag, so the TUI had to reverse-engineer the phase from message parts and every other client got nothing at all. `busy` now carries an optional phase (preparing, thinking, writing, tool, compacting), the tool being run, the step number, and when the phase started. The fields are additive: readers that discriminate on `type` alone are unaffected. The TUI uses them for the window the parts cannot describe — before the first byte arrives — and shows the step number, so a turn on its eighth step no longer looks the same as one that just started.
