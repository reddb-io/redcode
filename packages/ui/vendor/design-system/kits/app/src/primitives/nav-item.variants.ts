// NavItem's styling. See button.variants.ts for the split, the colour rule and
// the spatial rule.
//
// The active state wears the shared selection language (DESIGN.md,
// "Interactive states"): a neutral surface, full-weight foreground ink, and a
// 2px ink bar on the start edge. Ink, not the Brand red (wave 6A): the red bar
// on the selected surface measured 2.49-3.01:1 on the light grounds, under
// WCAG 1.4.11's 3:1, so the whole selection language moved to ink. Its width
// is a plain border width, like every other rule the Kits draw. Every item
// carries the same edge, transparent until it is current, so moving the
// current page shifts nothing.
//
// A horizontal rail of items (BottomNavigation) moves the bar to the edge it
// sits against through its own slot class.
//
// Opacity is doing the work an extra surface token would otherwise do, which
// is the same choice button.variants.ts made and for the same reason: the
// Tokens Layer ships no second surface yet.
