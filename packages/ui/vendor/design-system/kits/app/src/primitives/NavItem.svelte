<!--
  NavItem — a Primitive: it imports no other Kit component.

  One entry in a navigation list. Like ListRow it derives its element — an <a>
  when it goes somewhere, a <button> when it only does something — but unlike
  ListRow it also has to say *where you are*: `current` sets `aria-current`, so
  the current page is announced and not merely tinted. Colour alone would leave
  a screen reader with a list of identical links.

  The trailing rail is a snippet, which is how a caller hangs a Badge or a Kbd
  off an item without this component importing either.
